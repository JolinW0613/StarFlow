## Elevator Pitch: 
We are building an intelligent platform for entertainment companies, including artists, agents, investment advisers and platform administrators, to help them drive their work and improve efficiency with data.

At present, the management of the entertainment industry is decentralized and information is confused, resulting in inefficient communication and decision-making among artists, agents and investment advisers. Our platform addresses these pain points by centrally managing performance schedules, contracts, financial data and market analysis.

Artists can check their itineraries and earnings at any time, investment counselors can efficiently manage multiple artists, investment advisors can accurately analyze project returns with data dashboards, and platform managers can ensure system security and content compliance.

Core features include: intelligent schedule and contract management, investment analysis dashboard and back office rights management system. We enable the entertainment industry to collaborate more smoothly and make smarter decisions.
